# Welcome to Pantry Perfect!

Hello! Pantry Perfect is a web application that allows a user to track the quantity of the items they regularly buy so that they can see how much food they need to purchase without going home first. Users can also add regularly cooked recipes and tie them to the items they track, so that they can build a grocery list on the fly by what meal they want to cook. The application updates the pantry quantities based on user input, and tracks certain stats so that the user can see their most cooked meals and most frequently thrown out groceries.

The true purpose for this application is to remove the pain point of having to go home first to see how much food you need to buy for dinner. Typically, people shop for many meals at a time to help eliminate this problem. Realistically, though, life has a way to intervening and pushing meals back or completely out of the plan. Days go by, food spoils, the trash can gets fed, and guilt sets in as you see dollar signs float away and remember that there are starving people all over the world.

The target user is one who wants to be fiscally and socially responsible about food waste and would shop for one or two meals at a time to help fight that. The application is designed to eliminate the pain points of that reality.

## Pantry UI

Below are some helpful gifs for how to make use of pantry perfect once you visit!

For the best demonstraction of all of the features, a base profile has been built with quite a bit of starter data to play with. At the login screen, type 

username: ricky
password: 123

![Login Demo](https://github.com/ricky-bruner/Pantry-Perfect-Midstone/blob/master/readmegifs/login.gif?raw=true)

Once logged in, there are several pantry items already entered for perusal. You can add new items, edit current items, and even delete them. You may also convert the quantity type into whatever format works best for you from a list, and designate an amount to "toss". You may also entirely reset the amount to whatever you choose.

On the recipes side, you may add a recipe and the ingredients that you track for it. Recipes can be "favorited" or "unfavorited" by clicking the heart icon next to the title. Details can be viewed and hidden as well. When the *cook?* icon is clicked, a popup will appear giving you a view of that the recipe calls for vs what if currently "in stock" in the pantry. Green means you have more than enough to cook the meal, blue means you have exactly enough, and red means you are short and need to shop. You may select the ingredients that youd like to buy with the slider next to it, and select *Add to Grocery List* below to build a grocery list.
